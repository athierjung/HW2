		<h2> About Me </h2>
		
				<p>
				I am currently a senior at the University of Iowa double majoring in Business Management and Business Information Systems.  I grew up in the Northwest suburbs of Chicago and attended Prospect High School.  
				At Prospect High School,  I played basketball all four years (started my senior year on varsity), volleyball and was in the Ultimate Frisbee Club.  
				My team and I won the Ultimate Frisbee championship when we were seniors and passed on our team name to a team of younger students, who then turned our name into a dynasty by winning three straight championships 
				after we left.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Before applying to colleges, I had already knew that I wanted to attend a Big 10 school.  I am a big sports fan and the Big 10 was right up my alley for competitive and skilled athletic teams.
				After determining that I wanted to attend a Big 10 school, I had to start weighing the costs(literally) and the benefits of each school.  I chose Iowa because it was far enough away from home but not too far, I 
				loved the campus and downtown area &amp; the cost to attend was reasonable compared the other Big 10 schools I got accepted into.  I truly made the best decision by coming to the University of Iowa and I couldn't
				imagine going somewhere else.  I feel privileged and proud to be apart of the Tippie Business School at the university of Iowa.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				I only have one year left of the wonderful college life before I have to put my big boy pants on and enter the real world.  To be honest, thinking about that is pretty scary but at the same time I believe I am
				ready to show the business world what I am made of.  After graduation, I would love to backpack around Europe for sometime before starting my career.  Being open minded to new experiences and stepping out of your
				comfort zone is what makes this wild, complex life so interesting and meaningful.
				</p>
